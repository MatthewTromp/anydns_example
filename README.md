# Anydns example application
This is a simple example application for [Anydns](https://github.com/MatthewTromp/anydns). 
It fetches a certificate for the host's current anydns.online subdomain and initializes a simple server.
This server could be extended to, for instance, host a file for fast, encrypted, peer-to-peer file transfer.
